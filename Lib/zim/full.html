        // SCALING OPTIONS
        // scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
        // "fit"		sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
        // "outside"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
        // "full"		sets stage to window size with no scaling
        // "tagID"		add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

        var scaling = "full"; // makes stage the window size but does not scale content

        var frame = new Frame(scaling); // see docs for more options and info
        frame.on("ready", function() {
            zog("ready from ZIM Frame");

            var stage = frame.stage;
            var stageW = frame.width;
            var stageH = frame.height;
            frame.color = yellow; // ZIM colors now available globally

            // put your code here (you can delete this code)

            var button = new Button(140, 60, "ZIM", grey, dark);
            // will position and scale the code in the resize function at bottom
            button.on("click", function() { // on() is like addEventListener()
                zgo("http://zimjs.com/frame.html"); // or relative URL, target is available too
            });

            // put resizing code in here
            // resize also gets called initially
            frame.on("resize", resize);

                stageW = frame.width;
                stageH = frame.height;
                // can redraw things at different sizes or use scaling here
                button.scaleTo(stage, 20); // also see zim.Layout() for more complex scaling
                button.center(); // centers on stage - addTo() and others as well!
                stage.update();
